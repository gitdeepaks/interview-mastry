Ques 1: What will be the output of the following code?
Explanation: The output will be:
Driving a vehicle
Driving a car

This is because vehicle.drive() invokes the drive() method from the Vehicle prototype, while car.drive() invokes the overridden drive() method in the Car prototype.

Ques 2: Explain the difference between **proto** and prototype in JavaScript.
Explanation:
**proto**: It points to the prototype of an object and is used for inheritance and accessing the prototype chain.
prototype: It exists on constructor functions to set up inheritance for objects created by that function, defining shared properties and methods for instances.

Ques 3: What is setPrototypeOf?
Explanation: setPrototypeOf is a method used to set the prototype (the object's internal [[Prototype]]) of a specified object to another object or null. It allows changing the prototype dynamically after an object has been created.

Ques 4: What is instanceof?
Explanation: instanceof is an operator that checks if an object is an instance of a specific constructor or its prototype chain. It returns true if the object is an instance of the constructor or a constructor's prototype chain.

Ques 5: How can you create an object without a prototype in JavaScript?
Explanation: You can create an object without a prototype by using Object.create(null). This creates an object with no prototype chain, making it free from any inherited properties or methods.

Ques 6: What will be the output of the following code?
Explanation: The output will be:
10
20
30

This is because obj1 is an instance of A with foo as 10, obj2 is an instance of B with foo as 20 (overridden from A), and obj3 is an instance of C with foo as 30 (overridden from both A and B).

Ques 7: Deep Clone an object in JS
Explanation: The deepClone function recursively creates a deep copy of an object, including nested objects and arrays, ensuring that the cloned object is completely independent of the original object.

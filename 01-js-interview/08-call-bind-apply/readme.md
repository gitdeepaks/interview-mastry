Question 1: What is Call?
Explanation:
The call method in JavaScript is used to invoke a function with a specified this context and arguments individually. It accepts the context object as the first argument followed by individual arguments.

Question 2: What is Apply?
Explanation:
The apply method in JavaScript is similar to call but accepts arguments as an array. It is used to invoke a function with a specified this context and an array of arguments.

Question 3: What is Bind?
Explanation:
The bind method in JavaScript is used to create a new function with a specified this context. It doesn't immediately execute the function but returns a new function that can be invoked later.

Question 4: Output
Explanation:
The first console.log outputs "Piyush is 24" because call immediately invokes the function with the specified context and arguments. The second console.log outputs the bound function because bind creates a new function but doesn't execute it.

Question 5: Call with function inside object
Explanation:
The call method is used to invoke the getAge function of the person object with a different context (person2). It returns the age property of person2, which is 24.

Question 6: Output
Explanation:
The first console.log outputs "🥑" because data.getStatus() returns the status property of the data object. The second console.log also outputs "🥑" because data.getStatus.call(this) uses call to explicitly set the context to the global object, accessing the same status property.

Question 7: Call printAnimals such that it prints all animals in object
Explanation:
The printAnimals function is invoked using call within a loop to print each animal's species and name from the animals array with the correct index.

Question 8: apply to append an array to another
Explanation:
The apply method is used to push all elements of the elements array into the array using the spread operator (...elements).

Question 9: Using apply to enhance built-in functions
Explanation:
The apply method is used to find the maximum number in the numbers array by passing the array as arguments to Math.max.

Question 10: How will you Create a bound function
Explanation:
A bound function is created using the bind method. In this case, f is bound to null, and the resulting function is assigned to user.g.

Question 11: Bind Chaining?
Explanation:
Bind chaining involves calling bind multiple times on a function. However, only the first bind call is effective in setting the this context. Subsequent bind calls have no effect.

Question 12: Fix the code
Explanation:
The checkPassword function prompts for a password and calls either loginSuccessful or loginFailed based on the input. bind is used to ensure that this inside loginSuccessful and loginFailed refers to the user object.

Question 13: Partial application for login
Explanation:
The checkPassword function is modified to accept two callbacks, ok and fail. The login method in the user object is then passed as arguments to askPassword, but the specific partial application is not provided.

Question 14: Explicit Binding with Arrow Function
Explanation:
Arrow functions do not have their own this context and instead inherit it from the surrounding lexical scope. Therefore, using call or bind with arrow functions doesn't change the context.

Question 15: Call Method Polyfill
Explanation:
A polyfill for the call method is provided, allowing a function (purchaseCar in this case) to be invoked with a specific context (car3) and arguments ('₹' and '60,00,000').

Question 16: Apply Method Polyfill
Explanation:
A polyfill for the apply method is provided, allowing a function (purchaseCar) to be invoked with a specific context (car2) and an array of arguments (['₹', '50,00,000']).

Question 17: Bind Method Polyfill
Explanation:
A polyfill for the bind method is provided, allowing a function (purchaseCar) to be bound to a specific context (car1) and arguments ('₹' and '1,00,00,000'). The bound function is then invoked to make a purchase.

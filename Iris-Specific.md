## 1. Removing Duplicates in an Array (ES6)

### **Q1**: How do you remove duplicate items from an array in JavaScript using ES6?

**Answer and Explanation**:  
One of the cleanest ways is by using the **Set** object, which stores unique values. Then you can spread the set back into an array.

```js
// Using Set and Spread:
const arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
const uniqueArr = [...new Set(arr)];
console.log(uniqueArr); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

You could also use **Array.prototype.filter** in combination with `indexOf`:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
const uniqueArr = arr.filter((item, index) => arr.indexOf(item) === index);
console.log(uniqueArr); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## 2. Hoisting

### **Q2**: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

**Answer**:  
Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope (global or local). This means variable and function declarations are accessible before their actual line of code is executed (though the value might still be `undefined` for variables if you use `var`).

### **Q3**: Can you show a quick code snippet demonstrating hoisting?

```js
console.log(myVar); // undefined (due to hoisting, the declaration is moved up)
var myVar = 10;

hoistedFunction(); // "I am hoisted!"
function hoistedFunction() {
  console.log("I am hoisted!");
}
```

- The `var` variable is hoisted but **initialized** with `undefined` until it’s assigned `10`.
- The `function` declaration is fully hoisted, so calling `hoistedFunction()` before it appears in the code works.

**Note**: `let` and `const` are also hoisted, but they cannot be accessed before their declaration (this is often referred to as the “temporal dead zone”).

## 3. ES6 Spread and Rest

### **Q4**: Explain the difference between the **spread** operator (`...`) and the **rest** parameter (`...`).

**Answer**:

- **Spread** (`...`): Expands the elements of an iterable (like an array) into individual elements. Often used in array literals, function calls, or object literals.
- **Rest** (`...`): Gathers multiple function parameters (or object/array items) into a single array (or object), effectively compressing items.

### **Q5**: Give an example of the spread operator in use.

```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [4, 5];
const combined = [...arr1, ...arr2]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { c: 3 };
const mergedObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 }; // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
```

### **Q6**: Give an example of the rest parameter in a function.

```js
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // 10
```

## 4. Arrow Functions

### **Q7**: How do arrow functions differ from traditional function expressions?

**Answer**:

1. **No own `this`**: An arrow function does not have its own `this`; it captures `this` from the enclosing context.
2. **No `arguments` object**: Arrow functions do not bind an `arguments` object; use rest parameters if you need it.
3. **Implicit return**: For concise body syntax, arrow functions return the expression without needing the `return` keyword.

### **Q8**: Provide a simple arrow function example.

```js
// Traditional function:
function double(n) {
  return n * 2;
}

// Arrow function:
const doubleArrow = (n) => n * 2;

console.log(doubleArrow(5)); // 10
```

## 5. HTML/CSS

### **Q9**: What are semantic HTML elements?

**Answer**:  
Semantic HTML elements clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. They make your markup more meaningful and improve accessibility and SEO.

### **Q10**: Explain the difference between `display: none` and `visibility: hidden` in CSS.

- **`display: none`**: Removes the element from the document layout flow entirely. Other elements will act as if the element does not exist.
- **`visibility: hidden`**: Hides the element but **reserves the space** in the layout. The element is just invisible, but still takes up space.

## 6. Redux

### **Q11**: What are the core principles of Redux?

1. **Single source of truth**: The state of your application is stored in one central store.
2. **State is read-only**: The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action.
3. **Changes are made with pure functions**: Reducers are pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state.

### **Q12**: How do you create a Redux store and connect it to a React app?

1. Install `redux` and `react-redux`.
2. Use `createStore` to create a store from your root reducer.
3. Wrap your root component with `<Provider store={store}>`.
4. Use `connect` or React-Redux hooks (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) to access or update the Redux state from your components.

```js
// store.js
import { createStore } from "redux";
import rootReducer from "./reducers";

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
export default store;

// index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import App from "./App";
import store from "./store";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## 7. General JavaScript Questions

### **Q13**: What are the different data types in JavaScript?

**Answer**:

- **Primitive**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `undefined`, `null`, `bigint`, `symbol`
- **Object**: Everything else (arrays, objects, functions, etc.) are objects in JavaScript.

### **Q14**: What is the difference between `==` and `===`?

- **`==`**: Loose equality; performs type coercion.
- **`===`**: Strict equality; no type coercion, both value and type must match.

## 8. Code Snippet Outputs (Arrow Functions, ES6, Event Loop, Closures)

Below are a few example code snippets a recruiter might show you and ask for the output. Practice walking through each line:

### **Snippet A**:

```js
const x = 5;

(function () {
  console.log(x); // ?
  const x = 10;
  console.log(x); // ?
})();
```

**Walkthrough**:

- Inside the IIFE, `x` is declared using `const x = 10`, but that declaration is hoisted in a “temporal dead zone” until the declaration line.
- The `console.log(x)` before `const x = 10` actually throws a **ReferenceError** because `x` is not accessible yet (different from `var`, which would be `undefined`).

**Answer**:

- The first `console.log(x)` **will cause a ReferenceError** (it won’t log `5`), because the `const x` inside the function shadows the outer `x`, but is not yet initialized.

### **Snippet B**:

```js
console.log(a); // ?
var a = 10;
(function () {
  console.log(a); // ?
  var a = 20;
})();
```

**Walkthrough**:

- `var a = 10;` is hoisted to the top, so `a` is declared but not assigned when the first `console.log(a)` runs → logs `undefined`.
- Inside the IIFE, `var a = 20;` is hoisted. So the second `console.log(a)` logs `undefined` again (within that function’s scope) before `a` is assigned `20`.

**Answer**:

- First `console.log(a)` → `undefined`
- Second `console.log(a)` → `undefined`

### **Snippet C** (Closures):

```js
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}
const counter = createCounter();
counter(); // ?
counter(); // ?
```

- Each time `counter()` is called, it increments `count` by 1 and logs it.
- The closure ensures `count` is preserved between calls.

**Answer**:

- First `counter()` → `1`
- Second `counter()` → `2`

## 9. Prototypes and Built-In Methods

### **Q15**: What is a prototype in JavaScript?

**Answer**:  
Every JavaScript object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]`. Prototype allows objects to inherit methods and properties from one another. When you access a property on an object, the JavaScript engine will first look for that property directly on the object, and if not found, it will check the object’s prototype chain.

### **Q16**: Show how you would add a method to `Array`’s prototype.

```js
Array.prototype.last = function () {
  return this[this.length - 1];
};

const nums = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(nums.last()); // 3
```

While you can do this, it’s generally recommended to avoid modifying built-in prototypes in production code.

## 10. React Hooks

### **Q17**: Explain the purpose of React Hooks.

**Answer**:  
Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Examples include:

- **useState** for local state
- **useEffect** for side effects
- **useContext** for context
- **useReducer** for complex state logic, etc.

### **Q18**: What are some best practices with Hooks?

1. Only call Hooks at the top level of your function (don’t call them in loops or conditionals).
2. Only call Hooks from React function components or custom Hooks.
3. Keep related state together. Use multiple `useState` or a `useReducer` for complex logic.

---

## 11. Performance Optimization (React + General)

### **Q19**: How can you optimize React performance?

1. **Memoization** using `React.memo` for functional components.
2. **`useCallback`** and **`useMemo`** to avoid re-creating functions or performing expensive calculations on every render.
3. **Code splitting** using `React.lazy` or dynamic imports.
4. **Avoid unnecessary re-renders** by breaking components down, passing only needed props.
5. **Use the Production Build**.

### **Q20**: Name some general JavaScript performance optimizations.

1. Minimize DOM manipulation.
2. Use efficient data structures.
3. Debounce or throttle expensive operations (e.g., scroll/resize events).
4. Use web workers for CPU-heavy tasks.

## 12. Batch Processing

**Often asked in a general or backend context, but can appear in front-end scenarios if dealing with large data sets.**

### **Q21**: What is batch processing?

**Answer**:  
Batch processing involves processing a large volume of data in groups (batches) without manual intervention for each piece of data. It is common in tasks like data transformations, scheduled daily/weekly data feeds, or background tasks.

### **Q22**: How might you handle batch operations in JavaScript/Node.js?

**Answer**:

1. **Use Streams** to handle data in chunks (if dealing with files or large data sets).
2. **Use a queue** (e.g., `bull`, `RabbitMQ`, or AWS SQS) for scheduling background tasks.
3. **Chunk your arrays** or data sets, then process each chunk in series or parallel with libraries like `async` or inbuilt `Promise.all`.

# Wrapping Up

**Key Tips for Your Interview**:

1. **Understand “Why,” not just “How.”** For each code snippet or concept, explain the reasoning behind it.
2. **Demonstrate knowledge of edge cases.** For example, hoisting behaviors differ between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
3. **Discuss real-world usage.** When talking about React Hooks or Redux, mention how you’ve used them in actual apps.
4. **Stay calm on trick questions** about snippet outputs. Just walk through them logically.

By reviewing these questions, practicing the code snippets, and understanding the underlying concepts, you’ll be well-equipped to tackle a range of JavaScript, React, Redux, and HTML/CSS interview topics.

Good luck with your interview!
